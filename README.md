Arcade Basketball Readme

This application is set to run on Firefox. When index.html is opened, press the enter key to begin playing. Once begun, use the mouse to aim the ball, click the mouse to shoot, double click (or press spacebar) to recall the ball to your hand. Press the + (plus) and - (minus) keys to change levels, each of which have a separate batch of statistics. Press the up and down arrow keys to change the power of the shot, which will be reflected in the colored pole overlaid onto the actual pole for the basket. The original force will be shown as green, and any other power level will make the pole yellow.
